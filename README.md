# HeartDiseasePrediction
Classification models to predict whether a person is likely to suffer from heart disease or not

Project includes:
  - EDA of given data
  - Feature Engineering to transform data 
  - Feature Selection
  - ML Classification models such as - Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest XGBoost
  - Classification model using ANN (Keras, Tensorflow)
  - Hyperparameter Tuning of models
  - Inferencing and concluding output from models
  
Do not run all cells of the notebook in one go. Hyperparameter tuning takes time to run depending on your system config. 8gb RAM recommended.
